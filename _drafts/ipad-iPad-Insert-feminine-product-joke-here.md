So I was supposed to write about the other 2 posts on TUAW regarding the iPhone wish list, but I figure I should just skip that and go right into the iPad, the latest gadget from Apple. For the last year I’ve been seeing rumors about the all mysterious “Apple tablet” that they’re working on. I couldn’t go one day without some site I browse having something about this damn thing. I actually was hoping that it would be something more than “a big iPhone.” I think my hopes got too high, and when I saw the announcement online I was just confused.

First thing, I’m really not a tablet PC type of person anyway, so I was hoping that it would at least have something different than other tablets, or even something so good that I might even want to get one. Lets face it, I do like my Apple products; my 80GB iPod, my old 40GB iPod, my MacBook Pro, the lab machines, the servers, etc. I enjoy using them for the most part and I believe that Apple does make quality products. And you already know my disdain for the iPhone from my last [two](http://yearofthegeek.net/2010/01/tuaws-iphone-4-0-wish-list-has-some-stupid-wishes/) [posts](http://yearofthegeek.net/2010/01/cell-phone-fussing/), so you can’t really say I’m a fanboy; meaning I’m not going to buy everything Steve Jobs says because he said to, NO. I’m going to buy a product I feel has a use in my life, and that I will like to use. And the iPad just doesn’t do it for me.

There are many things that they should/could have done differently with it, but they didn’t. I admit, it’s very nice looking and I *can* see *some* uses for it (below) but I just don’t think it’s practical for most.

The iPad would be an excellent control for, say, a media system or a professional presentation. I can see people buying one of these for their office to use as a datebook or a replacement for magazines and newspapers or even to control things in their office (lights, music, etc). Using it as an eReader or an internet device when on the road? I just don’t see it. Reading the screen would probably be like reading a book on your computer screen, you’ll go blind. Why is the Kindle so popular? It uses e-ink and doesn’t blind you with back lighting. That’s the whole point of it. Don’t get me wrong, using the iPad as a magazine or newspaper reader would be great, you can’t do that shit with e-ink but $400 for a magazine reader? I don’t know…

I also don’t see people buying this thing as a gaming device. (Yes, I know that’s not the point of the iPad) Sure, it can do some nifty graphics and tilt functions, but it’s so big compared to a Nintendo DS or a PSP. And those systems won’t make you look like an idiot steering a box in public. And about the games and apps; all iPhone apps work on it, great, now I can have an iPhone sized app running on my 9 inch tablet, way to utilize the screen space. Yeah, you can zoom in, but what happens when you zoom in on things that weren’t meant to be zoomed in on? That’s right, it looks like a piece of mosaic.

The drawing features are nice. I can see many artists or designers wanting this to sketch out things on the fly and be able to send it to someone without a scanner or whatnot…but why not take that a step more? Make a deal with Wacom and allow it to become an actual Wacom tablet. Charge like $50 for an app that when you plug it into your PC it shows the screen of the PC and allows you to draw on it! Genius! That would actually make it multifunction; hell I’d consider buying it then.

Speaking of multifunction, I must say this:

HAHAHAHAHA!

They didn’t learn that people really wanted multitasking. I know many folks who were very pissed off about this and I just ask them, “you’re surprised?” Good luck on the next update.

Oh and another one: Think they’d learn from their AT&amp;T problems?

AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

Unfortunately, sticking with AT&amp;T was inevitable; the iPhone is AT&amp;T only, so why in the hell would they move to another carrier? If they released a new iPhone for Verizon then I’d see it to be more plausible…until then, enjoy your AT&amp;T iPad users!

Oh and the name…iPad? You’re fucking Apple! You couldn’t have used one of the much better names like iTablet or my personal favorite, the iSlate? You went with the name in which [MadTV did a skit](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsjU0K8QPhs) on already making the joke that everyone is making now? Wow. Someone missed that joke from like 3 years ago. That’s why people are making those jokes, not really because of the maxipad/pad reference, but because it was already a stupid joke on MadTV.

I’m not saying that the iPad is a failure, or it’s a completely useless product, because it’s not. I’m just giving my $0.02.
