**Logos**

*PolyBOTS “Corporate” Logo*

Created for business cards and letterheads when I was president of the Polytechnic Robotics Club. This logo was not used because the PolyBOTS did not want a corporate-looking logo. This was created in February 2006 as a personal project.

*ViEye Logo*

Created for my Undergraduate Senior Project. I wrote an idea for a wearable computing system called ViEye.([Link](http://polybots.poly.edu/~john/mwiki)) The logo was created specifically for the project. This logo was created in Spring 2007 as part of a project.

*JCViewer Logo*

Created for JCViewer, a 3D Flash based image viewer.<span class="__mozilla-findbar-search" style="padding: 0pt; background-color: yellow; color: black; display: inline; font-size: inherit;"></span> JCViewer was a joint project for DM9103B: Flash and Actionscript Studio in Fall 2008 between myself and [Christopher DiMauro](http://widgetsworkshop.com/). This logo was created in Fall 2008 as part of a project.
