Hi, I’m John. I work in [higher-ed](http://www.uarts.edu) as a [Casper](http://jamfsoftware.com) administrator and have worked in education my entire life.

I purchased this domain years ago in an attempt to put al of my digital life in one place. I used to put papers that I’ve written, videos that I shot/edited, and graphics I’ve created on here. It turned out that I really didn’t need that and ended up posting only about any random technology-related things that I felt people would enjoy. That proved to be a better use of the bandwidth so, I think I will start over and try to do that again but with more focus.

I’m going to try to post scripts that I’ve written, methods of doing things that I’ve found to work, and any walkthroughs that I think people will find useful. I can tell you with 100% certainty that this will not be updated often. I may go months without posting a single thing. But I’m going to try my best to at least post meaningful things that people will (hopefully) find useful.

So, with that, I present the *new* Year of the Geek which is the same as the old. Only less random junk.
