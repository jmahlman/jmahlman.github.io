I love my [DROID](http://yearofthegeek.net/2010/01/cell-phone-fussing/ "Cell Phone Fussing"), I have since I got it over a year ago. But in a year, a lot can happen with technology of course. My phone was originally equipped with Android 2.1 (the first phone to have it actually) and had an ARM 600MHz processor (underclocked to 550 for battery life), and 256MB RAM. It was fast, really fast…and it took a while for phones to be that fast…but it didn’t last long. Soon after the DROID came out every new phone that came out just got faster and faster very quickly..I mean, that’s what technology does, right? But the DROID looked slow very quickly.

So when Froyo (Android 2.2) came out the DROID got it down the line and that’s when the DROID started to show it’s age; extremely slow…a big drop in performance. So I decided to root it to get a little more millage out of it before my upgrade. Mind you, I was waiting for the [Thunderbolt](http://www.phonearena.com/phones/HTC-ThunderBolt_id4985 "Thundebolt via Phonearena") to come out to replace it…but decided against upgrading for the time…another story I suppose. I decided to use [SuperOneClick ](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=803682 "SuperOneClick")to root my phone, and damn it was simple. Literally one click and it was done…but what can I do with this root? Well, first thing was overclocking to see if I can get some more speed. I overclocked it to 800MHz and really didn’t notice much of a difference besides the fact that I could now have a wireless hot-spot…oh and I could take screen shots now (why doesn’t Android have this functionality built in? Seriously!).

My buddy was telling me about [CyanogenMod](http://www.cyanogenmod.com/ "CyanogenMod") and how he loved it on his MyTouch and basically brought life back into it. So I said “Why the hell not?” Not only does it add a lot of functionality, it will give me Android 2.3.3 (Gingerbread)…something the original DROIDs won’t ever see normally. I backed-up my apps and text messages phone using [MyBackup Root](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.rerware.android.MyBackupRoot "MyBackup Root") then flashed my recovery ROM to ClockworkMod which allows me to install firmware from the SD card and allows me to backup my entire phone to an image just in case anything goes wrong. After the backup with MyBackup Root I rebooted into recovery mode and backed-up the entire phone using the Nandroid backup (in the recovery) then started to flash CyanogenMod 7 on my phone..this meant I had to do a complete wipe of the phone which is always scary but with the backup I should be cool!

Wiped the phone, flashed the ROM, and booted the phone. It worked! I had the Release Candidate (at the time it was RC1) of CyanogenMod 7 on my phone!

I had some issues with CM7 at first and some issues with getting my apps back (which I’ll talk about in Part 2) but after some initial bumps I was up running as smooth as I could be on a release candidate. I had some reboots and some programs would crash but reinstalling them from scratch helped for the most part.

After a few updates it became more and more stable. I am now running RC4 with a new ultra-low voltage kernel (which allows me to overclock to 1GHz and uses less battery power than the stock kernel). which gives me good battery life, pretty good performance, and all around a pretty good experience.

It’s not up there with the new phones, but it does give your device a nice little jolt until you decide to retire it.

In Part 2 I’ll talk about installing all of the apps from backup and troubleshooting the many issues I had with memory issues and how they were resolved.
