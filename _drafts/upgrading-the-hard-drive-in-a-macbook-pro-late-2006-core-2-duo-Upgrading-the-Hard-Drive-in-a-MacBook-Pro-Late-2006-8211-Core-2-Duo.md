Thursday night my roommate and I decided to buy new hard drives for our Mac’s. I was running very low on my 100GB drive, and he wanted something better than his 160GB 5400RPM drive. I was looking into upgrading for a few weeks by now and was very tempted to buy this [320 GB Western Digital Scorpio](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822136280) that runs at 7200RPM. This is the same one that my boss, Carl, purchased for his MBP. The major difference is that he bought it from iFixit.com for $199.

I use one of the best programs for a Mac to backup your hard drive simply and cleanly, [Carbon Copy Cloner](http://www.bombich.com/software/index.html), and best of all, it’s 100% free. The backup takes roughly 2 hours using an external drive interface via USB, and I begin the dissection.

I’ve installed and replaced several parts in Powerbooks before but not a MBP. It’s relatively the same,, with the exception of a few screws and innards. I like using the How-To’s on iFixit.com, they have everything from drive replacement to replacing the screen for Mac laptops old and new. I use the one [suitable](http://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Mac/MacBook-Pro-17-Inch-Core-Duo/Hard-Drive-Replacement/87/8/Page-1) for my laptop of course, and in the end takes about 45 minutes or so to replace.

Almost 3 hours to backup and install a new 320GB hard drive into my laptop, not too shabby I think. Of course my roommate was done in about 2 hours because it is a lot easier to get to the hard drive on the new MacBooks, but that’s how it works.

The Good:

- Very easy to backup drive, CCC is very quick and safe
- No BIOS settings, plug the drive in, you’re done
- Fairly easy to get to drive once case is opened

The Bad:

- Too many screws to open MBP
- Apple uses some TORX screws to secure case and drive

The Verdict:

- Noticeable increase in speed with new drive (16mb cache)
- VERY quiet drive
- No vibrations (some people online complained about vibrations from the new drive)
- Well worth the $100
- Stay away from iFixit for hard drives;-)
