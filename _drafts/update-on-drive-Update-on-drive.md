So after some time with this new drive I’ll just give a quick update on it.

I love the new space of course. I an now keep all of my docs and programs happily as well as some extras. I’m not removing files left and right anymore to free up space for downloads, etc.

The computer seems to run a little hotter, it could just be me, and it does seem a tad bit louder than the original. My old drive was also a 7200RPM drive, but this one seems quieter seeking, but spinning sounds like a small fan (another one). I can deal with it though, doesn’t bother me.

Was it worth $100? Oh yeah!
