I own an iPod. To be more precise I actually own a 3rd Generation iPod; if you don’t know what kind that is, check it out on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_classic#Third_generation). It’s the first iPod to have a dock, the only iPod for have 4 light up buttons, lined on the top, and the iPod with the worst battery life, period. It also uses firewire to charge and sync, no USB charging on this guy.

My iPod is 40GB, and I’ve never filled it. But I love my iPod, I love how it looks, and I used to love how rugged it was. It’s been through a lot, here’s a run down of stuff:

- 3 batteries, all replaced by me
- 1 headphone connector
- dropped on asphalt and stepped on accidentally
- dropped in a sink full of water (not by me)
- dropped several times from my pocket to the ground
- sat on
- banged about

I bought it in 2003, when it was new, from eBay for $300. It has lasted me 5 long years, and now the battery is dying again (it only holds about an hour charge). I’ve finally given in and decided to buy a new one.

When looking, I decided to get another iPod, just because I like them, and I’m very impressed with my iPods durability. I decided to get a refurb from Apple. It’s the “previous generation”, basically meaning they don’t make it anymore. It’s 80GB, black, and $100 cheaper than the new ones. Of course I got Applecare for the additional $59. Worth it.

I am anxiously waiting for it to arrive from California now. I’m hoping that this new iPod gives me the same amount of life that my 3rd gen has given me. I of course will not be doing away with the 3rd gen, it’ll still be used for files and backups until something else on it dies (the hard drive or the port).

So, in this post I shall thank you 3rd Generation iPod. You’ve given me countless hours of entertainment, you’ve been around through my entire college career, and I know you’ll always be around somewhere for me.
