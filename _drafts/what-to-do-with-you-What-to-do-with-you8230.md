It’s been a long time since I’ve written anything here. I don’t really know why…I think I’m just feeling very uncreative. Maybe I’m just over the whole “blogging” thing. I was hoping this would actually make me want to write more, but it really hasn’t. Not recently at least. I also don’t feel as if I have much to write about.

I’m hoping to write some things about homebrewing in here this spring/summer. I’m going to be moving from 1-gallon batches to 5-gallons, and it might be a good place for me to share and store info about my brews. So there is always that possibility.

Hell, I’m paying for this domain and the hosting, might as well do something with it.

Wow this was a random/useless post.
