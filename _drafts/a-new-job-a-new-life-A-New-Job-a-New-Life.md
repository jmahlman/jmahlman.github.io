My last update back in February was going to have a follow-up post, but I got a little side-tracked with my life. Without going into much detail, I had a big change in my life for the better and I needed to move away from New York in order to complete my change and leave all of my negativity behind. In February I decided to move back to Philadelphia and with this move I would have to change jobs of course. I was looking for work for a few months before I moved (I knew I was going to move back many months before I actually did I just needed the job to come in before I could finally do it), and I received several interviews from very reputable companies and institutions. I was very close to working for another college, but due to circumstances that were beyond my control that job fell through.

I few weeks after that I applied for a job working for a technology consulting company that d0es work for independent k-12 schools in the Philadelphia Metro-area. I received a call-back the very next day and set up and interview within the next week. Three weeks later and I had a new job waiting for me on February 27th as a Senior Support Engineer for this company (I will leave my company name private for the time being).

My new job is similar to my work at Poly but also very different. I’m working with multiple clients, visiting different schools throughout the week and basically solving their tech issues both big and small. It’s a lot slower-paced than I’m used to, and the levels of work can range from basic software updates and printer repair all the way up to large scale wireless and network deployment and server room build-outs.

I have clients of my own (only about 2 right now) and in 6-months time I will be managing several more locations and possibly managing more of the company as a whole (scheduling, getting new clients, purchasing for schools, etc.). Its a very small company, just 4 full-time guys and one part-time, but there’s usually always something to do or someplace to be.

I don’t want this post to be ALL about the new job, so I’ll deviate a bit from that and mention that I did buy a car. It’s the newest car I’ve ever owned, and I love it. I did have to buy it because of work, but I wanted my own vehicle for some time. Anyway, it’s a 2005 Mazda 3i Sport, it’s metallic Grey with an interesting blue pinstripe.

It’s one of the smaller cars I’ve owned but I don’t need to carry 5 people around anymore..all of my friends drive now! Hopefully I’ll be able to put some customizations in it; maybe an in-dash navi/screen, but for now, it’s prefect for me.

Anyway, I will try to update more with my new job fun. I’ll probably have to be vague about some details of work (you know… k-12 schools and all) but hopefully I can sneak some writing time in more often and maybe some different types of updates (maybe car mods/work!).
