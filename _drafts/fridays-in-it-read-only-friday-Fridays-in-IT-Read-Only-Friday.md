Read-Only Friday. Itâ€™s an IT tradition that I really think every company should abide by. Seriously, I really think every IT company should have it in a contract or something. What is it? Well, Friday is the last day of the weekâ€¦so you should do everything in your power to not have a terrible weekend by updating or making <span style="text-decoration: underline;">any</span> changes to your production environment on a Friday. Friday in the IT world should be for emergency calls and finishing up projects you had during the weekâ€¦not for installing that new software for your users or installing that shiny new UPS to replace one that is working, just old.

## Why the fuck is this important?

Well, if you install new software (or god forbid, hardware) on Friday you have to make sure that it fucking works by the end of the day for the user. Now, using new software might also be easy for you, so after installing and testing it youâ€™re done, right? **NOPE!** Remember, the user is used to the old stuff, so theyâ€™re not going to know a damn thing about the new software you just installed for them most likely. Theyâ€™re going to call you for every little thing they need help with..EVERYTHING. And if they canâ€™t get something working, youâ€™re stuck helping them. Now, if the program install doesnâ€™t go smoothlyâ€¦youâ€™re screwed. Youâ€™ve gotta make sure itâ€™s working for Monday, so guess what? Youâ€™re staying until itâ€™s working.

Itâ€™s worse for hardware. If that brand new thing doesnâ€™t work right (and you know it wonâ€™t) youâ€™re stuck there..and if you think youâ€™re good on Friday..wait. Youâ€™ll get that call on Saturday that you NEED TO BE AT WORK TO FIX THAT NEW THING CAUSE ITâ€™S NOT WORKING RIGHT! Yeah. It happens more often than people think.

So..Friday is really the worst time to do ANY upgrades or installs in IT. Seriously..I just was told by a client who isnâ€™t here (sick) to install a new version of Adobe Creative Suite on a usersâ€™ computer. CS6 changed a whole lot from CS5. So, like a moron, I do it. Iâ€™ve now been called 3 times already by this person because they donâ€™t know the new layout of CS6. Iâ€™ve had to go across campus 2 times for this person. Iâ€™m waiting for the phone to ring againâ€¦I just know itâ€™s going to happen.

## Why did I install new shit today?!?

Well, being client work, I have to make the client happy. If thatâ€™s what they want, thatâ€™s what they get. One good thing though? If something else goes wrong after 3PM (when Iâ€™m leaving) they have to deal with it themselves. ðŸ™‚

So please, everyone. If you work with IT people, donâ€™t ask them to do major shit to your production environment on Fridays. Itâ€™s a terrible fucking idea for everyone involved, especially the IT staff. Iâ€™m not even joking when I say that if I ever have my own IT staff, Iâ€™m putting read-only Friday as a real thing, mark my words. Friday is for planning, emergencies, and finalizing work. Thatâ€™s it. Nothing else.

Now Iâ€™m going to get ready to go home and have a beer.
