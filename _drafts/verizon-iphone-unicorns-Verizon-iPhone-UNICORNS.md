Okay, so it’s finally out, Verizon now has the iPhone. And unicorns are flying around now apparently. Of course the blogosphere and the media are insane right now but I have also seen my fair share of complaints and I laugh at a good amount of them. Some of them even make me want to slap someone. Let me go through them.

- **Not GSM, can’t use all over the world**: Okay, were you really expecting this? Verizon is CDMA, their phones work only in the US. Yes, they offer world phones, but did anyone really believe they’d make a “world iPhone?”
- **Not 4G/LTE**: Apple will not update the iPhone in the middle of it’s life cycle to put 4G in the device. Maybe the next one in July will have it, but expecting a 4G iPhone to come out today was really far-fetched.
- **Can’t use data and voice simultaneously**: Let me see. Anyone who would need this should know that CDMA cannot do this, it never has been able to and it never will. Why the hell would anyone expect the iPhone to suddenly let CDMA do this? It’s not about the phone people, it’s the network. In my life, I have probably had the need to do this maybe 4 times, and I’m a tech junkie! Maybe that’s me, but I still wonder how much people really need/care about this.
- **Verizon might install apps on the phone**: I don’t think Apple would allow this. They didn’t allow it on AT&amp;T….why would they allow it for Verizon? If they do, I’ll eat my shoe.

So those are really the fun ones I’ve heard. I’m sure there is someone out there who always uses data and voice, but then stay with AT&amp;T! If you travel out of the country a lot, chances are you don’t have Verizon anyway. I believe that these complains are from people on AT&amp;T fed up with them and they were hoping Verizon would swoop in and save them from everything bad about AT&amp;T…and are disappointed that they can’t just get everything they want. So a message; stop crying. You’re never going to get everything you want, face it.

## What will Happen Next?

How many people are going to jump the AT&amp;T ship to go to Verizon now? I know of a few off hand that will as soon as they can. Honestly, switching carriers for a phone is just ridiculous. I always thought this, especially when everyone complained “Oh my god I can’t wait until the iPhone is on Verizon so I can finally dump AT&amp;T!” My question, why bother have a cell phone on a network that doesn’t make you happy? Isn’t the point of a cell phone to have cellular service? If you switch providers simply for a phone, then that’s dumb. Switch because one has the features you want, or because one’s cheaper, you know..a *good* reason. If you’re going to leave AT&amp;T now because you had shitty service and were just waiting for an iPhone to come to a better network, that’s even a good reason..that’s probably why most people will leave, but don’t complain when you can’t use your voice and data at the same time since you switched, that’s your own dumb fault for not knowing you can’t do it.

I also wonder how many Verizon Android users will hop over to the iPhone. I know this will happen (again, I already know of some people who are thinking of doing this), but I really want to see how many people will end up doing this. I myself have thought, “Humm, if a Verizon iPhone came around, would I go for it?” I do like the iPhone hardware and iOS is nice but I’m very happy with Android and I see very good Android devices coming out in the near future. I’m also used to it’s features and I know I’d miss some of them if I went to the iPhone. Only time will tell, but come August when I’m up for a new phone I hope to have a choice of some LTE Android phones or even an LTE iPhone.

Wrapping up, what does this change? Nothing much. People will still switch companies for a phone, and people will still not be happy with things they’ve wished for. Not a single person will get everything they want from their phone or network, and that’s the way it will be forever. I want a device that can work on CDMA and GSM and underground, but guess what? That’s not happening. Am I going to complain and call something I waited for a failure? No, because these are *my* wants, *my* needs. Cell companies and device makers don’t have an obligation to anyone. This iPhone hype was all created by the media. All of these wishes were created by the media. Verizon and Apple didn’t promise anybody anything, they simply said “we have an announcement” and that’s all it took for everyone to go ape shit and expect all of these things from the device, hell people didn’t even know it was actually an iPhone announcement until they said it. It could have been a Windows Phone 7 announcement! The fact of the matter is that you can’t always get what you want. Listen to the Stones, people.
