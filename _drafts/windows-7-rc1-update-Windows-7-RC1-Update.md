I updated my Windows 7 install to build 7100 (RC1). Some minor changes have been made on the outside. More themes are available, more sounds, different login screen background, yadda yadda.

As for the performance, I don’t notice too much of a change really.

Because Microsoft disallows upgrades from 7 Beta to 7 RC1 I had to wipe the drive and start over, no big deal though since I don’t use my Windows partition for much more than Steam.

My opinions still stand, Windows 7 seems to be very solid and visually appealing. I you’re one of those people who still run XP and were weary of switching to 7 instead of Vista (I was), I’d suggest you upgrade it if your hardware is up to snuff. Yeah, I think it’s really that good.
