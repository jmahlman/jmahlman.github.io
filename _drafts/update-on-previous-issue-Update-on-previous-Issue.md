So, very odd things are happening. First, our DNS server is not taking updates for some reason, unless Poly isnâ€™t sending updates for some reason. Either way, on my network, the site does not work, on any other network, itâ€™s fine now. Second, the site that was originally setup was not working of course, but I decided to do some trickery. I wanted to see if the system was actually working properly, or if it was actually the WordPress install. I switched the working virtual host home directory with the Word Press one, and lo-and-behold, it didnâ€™t work. I just uploaded a fresh WordPress install to the proper directory, and itâ€™s now a working site!

Turns out it was NOT Leopard server, but the WordPress configuration. So let this be a lesson, always start fresh if you can. ðŸ™‚
