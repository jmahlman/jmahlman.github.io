I’m trying to figure out a domain to purchase for this site, haven’t figured one out yet though. I also don’t know if I want to continue hosting this on the IDMI student server; the Poly network seems to be worse in recent.

So as a temporary solution I’m using DynDNS, [http://johnmahlman.is-a-geek.net](http://johnmahlman.is-a-geek.net "http://johnmahlman.is-a-geek.net"). It’s only a redirect for now, but hopefully I can have a real domain.
