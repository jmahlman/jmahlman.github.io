This page contains various video’s that I have filmed throughout the years. I will add more as I find them and upload them. I prefer to host videos off-site, it’s easier and uses less bandwidth.

**Narrative: Hipster Safari, January 2008**

*A short video piece I filmed for DM9103B in Fall 2008 at Polytechnic Institute of NYU’s Integrated Digital Media Program. The assignment was to film and edit a narrative/documentary. I chose to do a mockumentary which was dubbed “Hipster Safari”.* **Interview with Chris “the Widget” DiMauro, February 2008**

*A short video piece I filmed for DM9103B in Fall 2008 at Polytechnic Institute of NYU’s Integrated Digital Media Program. The assignment was to interview someone and edit it. This interviewee is Chris DiMauro of the PolyBOTS.* **Vintage Performance of Rock Medley, December 2005**  
  
*This was one of my first filmed/edited pieces. For my Video Production class in Fall 2005 I filmed a 2.5 hour long concert held at Poly which is called the Poly Music Showcase. I chose my favorite and best edited piece as the final, and this was it. I do not have the original video, so this badly-encoded video will have to suffice. **Please note:** The audio is distorted due to the volume of the performers at the time. The audio was taken directly from the mixing board.*
