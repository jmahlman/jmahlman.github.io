On June 21 the [Greater Philadelphia Mac Admins](https://phillymacadmins.com/) held their monthly meet-up (also their 3 year anniversary!). I decided I wanted to present my DEPNotify process to the group. The event was recorded and live-streamed. If you’re interested in watching the recording, you can head over to [this](https://youtu.be/Jk5Snii-nWA?t=32m40s) Youtube link or view below. My presentation begins around 32:40.

You can find the presentation slides [here](/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DEPNotify-Presentation.pdf).

If you’re in the area and an IT professional and you’re interested in Mac administration you should come out to our meet-ups! I’m a co-organizer so I am at most of the events. We typically hold them at the Walnut Street Apple store and we’ve been hosting social meet-ups at local restaurants/bars every other month.
