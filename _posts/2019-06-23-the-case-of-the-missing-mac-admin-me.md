If you’re a visitor to this site you may notice that I have not had an update in sometime. I also haven’t really done any changes to my Git Page either, both stopped in November.

### Coincidence? Not really

In November, I left my previous position at the University of the Arts and started working for a large financial company in the area. This change had a few side-effects that I didn’t think about. First was that I don’t have much time to do any experimenting with new tech, so I’m not really engineering any cool solutions for problems.

The second side-effect is that I don’t have a heck of a lot of time anymore to write up blog posts (I’m actually writing this on the last day of my vacation). Moreover, even if I do have something to write about I have to be a bit more careful about what I share; this includes scripts. What this means is that I’ve basically stopped sharing anything just in case I’m not allowed to do so.

### So, what does this mean?

Well, it just means that I’ll be writing here less that I did in the past. I’m hoping that once things get a little more settled in my new company I’ll have time to engineer some cool things and share them, but in the near future I’m focusing all time on my job and getting the Mac platform to where it should be at my company.

I am still hoping to dive into DEPNotify again (especially with all of the changes that are coming with macOS Catalina), and make sure my scripts still work with it, but I’ve just not had the time to do any of that. I’ve also not been able to provide the documentation that I promised, which really stinks. I’ve been asked to speak a few times about any updates to my process since November and frankly, I’ve not been keeping up on it because I just have so much else to do as noted above, so I’ve turned down a few speaking engagements.

Such is life, I guess. Work comes before my blog.
