## About Me

My name is John, I’m an Apple IT tech based out of Philadelphia. I have a B.S. in Technical and Professional Communication and an M.S. in Integrated Digital Media from NYU-Poly (which has changed names so many times since I’ve left I’m just calling it that).

I’m just a big geek.

Other things I like: food, beer, motorcycles, animals, food, beer, home-brewing, food, and beer. I spend a lot of time in the [MacAdmins](http://macadmins.org) slack channel (@jmahlman).

I am available for speaking and training, please head over to my [contact page](/contact) for my email or hit me up on slack.
